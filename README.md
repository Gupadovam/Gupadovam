# Hi, I'm Gutavo Padovam!ðŸ‘‹

* I'm a Computer Engineering student at Technological Federal University of ParanÃ¡
* I'm passionate about competition of any kind, especially involving sports and intellect. 
* At the moment, I'm engaged in research and development on Ultrasound at AUSPEX 2, and in my free time, I'm learning web development.
* 20 years old and live in Curitiba - ParanÃ¡, Brazil
* Fun fact: I've cut my head 5 times... and I haven't given up sports yet!
